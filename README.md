# chrome-tabs
Grouping of Salesforce tabs by Org

## Installation
> NOTE: This is **not** available publically, and is installed unpacked. Buyer beware.

1. [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/)
2. Choose "Load Unpacked"
3. Select the parent directory (chrome-tabs)
4. Your Salesforce tabs should now be grouped by org! (also workbench has it's own)

## Notes
* This depends fully on the URL, and is very immature. If your org URL is different, and doesn't have the structure I planned for, it probably won't work. Haven't tested scratch org or developer orgs yet.
* A new tab only updates once it's within the matching URL. When a tab is updated, it will not bring other tabs along with it, only the one that changed.
